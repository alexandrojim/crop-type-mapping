These dataset splits correspond to the unique ids of the 64x64 tiles available on Radiant Earth's ML Hub. 
- Ghana dataset: http://registry.mlhub.earth/10.34911/rdnt.ry138p/
- South Sudan dataset: http://registry.mlhub.earth/10.34911/rdnt.v6kx6n/

To create the exact inputs used in the models in this repo, and reported in the accompanying paper, these 64x64 tiles were further broken down into 32x32 tiles due to memory contraints during the training process.
